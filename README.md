# Ovariectomized: Vehicle or Estrogen (ovx_ve):
Notebook of scRNA-seq analysis from cells collected from the mouse oviduct.
Adult (8-12 weeks old) C57B6/J mice were ovariectomized (OVX) and treated with either vehicle (V) or estrogen (E) for 24 hours.
The oviducts were dissected into infundibulum + ampulla (AmpIsth) or isthmus + uterine-tubal junction (IsthUTJ) before single cell isolation.
